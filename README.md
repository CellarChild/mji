![Gif showing mji in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unlink2/misc-resources/main/mji-usage.gif)

Example usage:

```sh 
mji --help # display all options 

mji # start interactive prompt 

mji --commit # start prompt mode and run commit command (defaults to git commit -e -am <mji output>)

mji :sparkles: message 1 - :sparkles: message 2 # run mji in non-interactive mode 
```

The default commands for the header and commits can be change using the enviornment variables 
`MJI_HEADER_COMMAND` and `MJI_COMMIT_COMMAND`.

### Custom emojis 

The program will look for a configuration file called `mji.toml` in the system's default configuration
location (e.g. `$HOME/.config` on Linux). The config location can also be changed using a command line parameter. 
The file should have the following structure (one line per emoji): 

```toml
crab = {name = "crab", value = "ðŸ¦€", desc = "Made with Rust"} 
```
